To get project up and running, run the command 'git clone' with the project link after it into a code editor and navigate to project path. Run npm start and it should open up a web browser locally (localhost:3000). Run 'git checkout branch-one' to switch to branch with relative code.

* NOTE: The api wasn't consistent with their image paths so I pulled ones I know will work. Symbols, BTC, SOL, XRP, DOT, ETC, ETC, USDC and LTC all work and can be added, removed and updated.
